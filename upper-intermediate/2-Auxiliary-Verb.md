### Auxiliary Verb
- We have three auxiliary verb: be, do , have
#### Be
- We used "be" with verb_ing -> to make continuous forms. All continuous sentences need auxiliary verb "be"
- Pass continuous: want to talk situation or environments (birds were signing, the sun was shining)
- Present perfect continuous: (subject + have been + verb_ing) -> temporary -> the situation may change in the feature
    - Say something start in the past and continuous in present
    - I have been living in Seattle (current situation - maybe temporary)
    - Since(because) I have been studying English so much, I have a better understanding English of the language
- Present perfect (indicates that action is finished) Subject + have + v3
    - I have lived in Seattle (experience - used to)
    - How have you been? (We have met before, I want to know what happened since last we spoke)
- Subject + model verb(may, could, can, must, should, would,...) + infinitive (unchanged verb)
- infinitive verb == unchanged verb
- infinitive phrase = to + verb1 (unchanged verb)
- Difference between Past simple and present perfect
    - I read this book (action finished - says nothing about experience and memory)
    - I have read this book (action finished - more experience - I can retained this book - still have information this book in my head )
#### Do
- We use do, does, did for present simple or past simple tense -> Generally use in questions and negative sentences
- Used to express
    - I thought He didn't eat meat but "He does eat meat"
    - She said I didn't eat breakfast but I did breakfast

#### Have
- Have is used with past participles to make perfect verb form.
    - I haven't seen that film yet (present perfect simple)
    - She hadn't woken up when I called (pass perfect simple)
    - When you get home, I will have already cooked dinner (future perfect simple)
- Perfect form: Have/Had/Will Have + verb3
    - I have seen that movie.
    - I had cooked dinner the night before
    - I will have seen that movie three times when I watch it next Friday
