### Past Simple and Pass Continuos
- We use the past simple for specific time OR the action can't happen again
- Verb
    - + (positive): Subject + verb(#2) + object
    - - (negative): Subject + didn't + verb(#1)
    - ? (question): Did + subject + verb(#1) ?
- "Be" verb
    - + (positive): Subject + was/were + condition
    - - (negative): Subject + wasn't/weren't + condition
    - ? (question): Was/Were + subject + condition
    - Condition: adjectives, jobs, place
    - Adjective: big, happy, small, smart, bad...

- regular vs irregular
- We have a specific rule in English
    - In a sentence we have 2 verbs, main and second verb -> we need to change the second verb use:
        - to verb -> I hated to drink milk
        - verb_ing -> I hated drinking
- Past continuos
    - + (positive) Subject + was/were + V#1_ing
    - - (negative) Subject + wasn't/weren't + V#1_ing
    - ? (question) Was/Were + subject + V#1_ing
    VD: 
        - She has been signing for 3 hours
        - She is tired because she has been running (explaining the present -> why she tired)
- Past continuos + past simple
    - that mean 
        - past simple: it long action
        - past continuos: short/middle action
    - ex: I was walking and I saw a cat
    - It's doesn't matter you put past simple first or past continuos first
    - But when you use "while" -> you must to put the past continuos first
- Past continuos + past continuos -> that mean the action happened at the same time
    - The action can happen at the same time
        - singing and dancing
        - driving and listening music
- Past simple + Past simple -> different time
