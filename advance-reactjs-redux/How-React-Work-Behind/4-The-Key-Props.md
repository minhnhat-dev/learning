# The Key props
- Allow React distinguish between multiple instances of the same component type
## Using key in list
- Key help React distinguish with other
- not key -> same with react always re-render, React always create new element and reset state
## Using key to reset state
- Same position, different props, state -> React will mutate current React component (not re-created React element)
